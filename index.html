    Dear principal investigator,</p>
<p>

    I hope this finds you well. I believe I may have found a potential database for our project, given our research question– Is an alternative Mycobacterium Tuberculosis vaccine viable and what techniques would it rely on? I would like to propose the VIOLIN database.
</p>
<p>
    Cordial Regards,
    Ansh Chhabra

<p class = "heading1">Data in Database</p>
<p>
    VIOLIN (Vaccine Investigation and Online Information Network) is a database that focuses on information regarding vaccines – including literature, research data, and data analysis tools for vaccines and vaccine candidates. The most appropriate use of this database would be to research vaccines and the vectors through which they work. It functions as a secondary database as it presents a curated amalgamation of data from many different sources to provide a detailed profile on the vaccines and the conditions they treat. The primary data comes mostly from published research and other databases like the NCBI and Ontobee. As per the format, information is mostly presented as plain text with hyperlinks to the research papers from which it is obtained.

<p class = "heading1">
    Search
    </p>
<p>
    There are two ways to go about search on this database: Searching for target pathogens and searching for vaccines directly.
</p>
<p class = "heading2">
    Target pathogen search
</p>
<p>
    Attached is the link to the VIOLIN page for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: entry<a class="link" href="https://violinet.org/vaxquery/query_detail.php?c_pathogen_id=29&keywords=tuberculosis#References">[1]</a>. The pathogen page is indexed and curated to give you a table of contents, background information about the disease, in-depth research based data and references (presented in that order).  The research data includes the subsections “vaccines related to pathogen gene”, “vaccines related to host genes”, and “vaccine information”.  The first two of these subsections provide a somewhat detailed description of the genes targeted with hyperlinks to ncbi for any of the information that isn’t mentioned. The last section provides incredibly detailed information, creating a profile that contains the description, “Vaccine Ontology ID”, and data about the human response as well as other animal testing for every vaccine and vaccine candidates related to the pathogen. Everything stated is cited to either the independent research from where it is derived or to a primary database.
</p>
<p class = "heading2">
    Vaccine Direct Search
</p>
<p>
    Attached is the link to the VIOLIN page for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: entry<a class="link" href="https://violinet.org/vaxquery/vaccine_detail.php?c_vaccine_id=223&keywords=Tuberculosis">[2]</a>. The direct vaccine search provides us with a slightly more detailed version of the “vaccine information” page from target pathogen search. It creates a vaccine profile including  the ‘vaccine name’, ‘target pathogen’, ‘Vaccine Ontology ID’, followed by  information about its engineering, preparation and host response. Each one of these sections is cited to primary research and is incredibly detailed.

<p class = "heading1">
    Critique
</p>
<p>
    The database is relatively easy to operate and it is easy to find what you are looking for. The “Target Pathogen” pages are especially helpful as they provide a ton of information including a list of all relevant vaccines, which can lead to a more focused search. The following are my critiques on this database:
</p>
<p class = "heading2">
    Quality and Comprehensiveness
</p>
<p>
    The quality of the information seems fairly trustworthy as all sources are cited and come from reputable organizations like PubMed and NCBI. In addition, all information is subject to multiple rounds of critical review to verify its credibility.  The information is also quite comprehensive as the pages go into a fair amount of detail as well as provide the sources from which they got their information for further research.
</p>
<p class = "heading2">
    Addition of Features
</p>
<p>
    Some big features that VIOLIN lacks are visualization, and direct downloads. Databases such as NCBI have significantly more visualizations. For example, when looking at the apa<a class="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/885896">[3]</a> gene on NCBI, there are visualizations regarding the genes and nucleotide sequences that make the information easier to digest. In addition to this page, the option to download the data also exists making it easier to perform computations to actually use the data.

</p>


<p class = "heading1">Usage and Legality</p>
<p>
    A potential issue that we could run into if we used this database is the fact that the data can not be downloaded directly. A possible solution to this problem could be, downloading the information from a cited primary database or employing a scraping algorithm. As per legality, there are not any restrictions to this database. It is a subsection of the University of Michigan and is open to public use. VIOLIN does however, require that we cite the following given its usage:
</p>

<p class = "heading1">
    Conclusion
    </p>
<p>
    Although there are a variety of things that can be improved upon, I feel that VIOLIN is a good choice for the database that we utilize. It is comprehensive in the information that it provides and is very well cited in case we need to refer to the primary research for more in-depth data. Although the lack of a direct download option is inconvenient, it can be worked around using a scraping algorithm as mentioned earlier, or even manual data extraction. It is due to these reasons that I believe that VIOLIN, when used in addition to the primary research that it cites and other tools like NCBI, would be a fantastic tool for us to use in our research.
